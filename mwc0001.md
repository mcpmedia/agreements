Welcome to MCP Group Inc. 
## Domain
This "MCP Club Membership Agreement" (or "this Agreement") is to outline the specific details regarding the affiliation (or "the Membership") between MCP Club (as part of MCP Group Inc., or "the Company") and Yoon-Sung Kim (or "the Member") in order to protect all parties involved. This Agreement establishes the grounds for additional dependent contracts between the parties in the future.
## General
1. The Membership indicates that the Member is an official staff member of the Company.
    1. The company may assign a title to be used by the Member, especially if any dependent contracts apply.
2. This Agreement alone does not constitute any employment relationship, but may be used as the basis for both parties to enter into dependent contracts with additional terms.
    1. The Member has no direct obligations beyond the terms of this Agreement, and is therefore not guaranteed any compensation.
    2. As the Membership is intended to be mutually beneficial, it is encouraged that the Member provide assistance to the Company's operation, and be subjected to benefits provided in return.
3. With explicit permission from an official director of the Company, the Member may make use of the Company's resources, which may include tools, space or any property in any form.
4. The Member must not make any untruthful disparaging comments in any form that defames the Company, including after termination. 
5. The Member must not release any confidential information to any unauthorized persons, including that of the Company's clients or customers.
## Termination
1. Termination can be initiated by either Party with any cause and would subsequently cause all dependent contracts to terminate immediately.
2. Termination of any dependent contracts does not automatically terminate this Agreement unless specified explicitly.
3. Upon termination, the Member must return all Company properties and cease all control of Company resources based on this Agreement, as promptly as possible.
4. The Company reserves the right to retain information pertaining to the Member for the purpose of chain-of-custody record keeping after termination.
